## What is PromQL?

PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) is a functional query language designed specifically for querying time-series data in Prometheus. It allows you to select, aggregate, and perform calculations on metrics in real-time.

**Key Purpose:** PromQL transforms raw metrics into actionable insights by filtering, combining, and computing data across time ranges and label dimensions.

## Why PromQL Exists

Traditional databases use SQL for querying structured data in tables. Time-series databases need different capabilities:

- **Time-based calculations**: Rate of change, trends over time, predictions
- **Label-based filtering**: Query across dimensions (host, service, region)
- **Real-time aggregation**: Sum CPU across all servers, average response time per region
- **Vector math**: Compare metrics, calculate ratios, perform arithmetic

PromQL was built specifically for these operations on time-series data.
